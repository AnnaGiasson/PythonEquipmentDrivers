    """
    connect_equipment(config, **kwargs)

    Returns in instance of an EquipmentCollection object; an object containing
    multiple equipment instances as instance attributes. This simplifies the
    overhead needed to instantiate connections to an entire set of devices.

    This can be useful when repeatedly connecting to the same set of devices,
    or for ensuring different sets of equipment are instantiated as
    EquipmentCollection objects with the same attributes; allowing for easy
    reuse of the same test scripts using differents setups.

    The information required to configure the returned EquipmentCollection
    object is provided using the 'config' arguement which is either a
    path to a file or a dictionary containing the required information.

    Args:
        config (Union[str, Path, dict]): [description]

    Kwargs:
        object_mask (set, optional): A set of attribute names specified in the
            config information to connect. If any of the specified
            devices fail to connect an exception will be raised. Defaults
            behavior is to connect everything present.
        verbose (bool, optional): If True, instantiation, status, and error
            information will be printed to the console. Defaults to True.
        init (bool, optional): Whether or not to run any initialization
            sequences (if present) after connecting to a device. Defaults to
            False.

    Returns:
        EquipmentCollection: An object containing the device instances
            specified in 'config' as attributes.

    Examples:

    Expected JSON file format

    "device_name_1": {
                      "object": "Class_Name_1",
                      "definition": "Object_Definition_1",
                      "address": "Device_Address_1"
                      },
    "device_name_2": {
                      "object": "Class_Name_2",
                      "definition": "Object_Definition_2",
                      "address": "Device_Address_2"
                      },
        .
        .
        .

    "device_name_n": {
                      "object": "Class_Name_n",
                      "definition": "Object_Definition_n",
                      "address": "Device_Address_n"
                      }

    The "device_name" of each dictionary represents the name of the instance
    of class "object" to be connected to at address "address". The location to
    the definition of the class "object" needs to be provided using the key
    "definition". An example of this is shown below:

    "source_v_in": {
                    "object": "Chroma_62012P",
                    "definition": "pythonequipmentdrivers.source",
                    "address": "USB0::0x1698::0x0837::002000000655::INSTR",
                    "kwargs": {}
                    },

    If this device is connected and availible this will create an instance of
    the Chroma_62012P at the provided address. The source is defined in the
    pythonequipmentdrivers.source sub-module. This instance can be accessed
    using EnvironmentSetup('path_to_json file'). i.e. self.source_v_in
    There is an optional argument for each device "kwargs", if present the
    arugements contained in kwargs will be passed as keyword arguements in the
    instantation of the device, if not needed this can be omitted.

    The "object_mask" arguement can be used to connect to a sub-set of devices
    described in the JSON file. If used, object_mask should be an iterable
    containing the names of the devices in the JSON file that are desired.
    If all names contained in object_mask are not present in the JSON file an
    exception will be raised. Otherwise, this object will connect exculsively
    to the devices specified in object_mask.

    If init_ is True than this object will search the JSON file for an
    array named "init" which defines a sequence of commands to initialize the
    device. For example:

    "source_v_in": {
                    "object": "Chroma_62012P",
                    "definition": "pythonequipmentdrivers.source",
                    "address": "USB0::0x1698::0x0837::002000000655::INSTR"
                    "init": [
                             ["set_voltage", {"voltage": 0}],
                             ["off", {}],
                             ]
                    },

    In this example, If init is True and the device was successfully
    connected, this object will successively iterate through the array of
    command, arguement pairs; calling the commands listed using arguements (if
    any) provided. The commands listed must be valid methods of the device
    object, all arguements used will be passed as keyword arguements and
    therefore need to be named.
