The tox package is utilized to automate formatting and testing for this project. Getting started with tox couldn't be easier:

Install the tox python package using pip:

`pip install tox` or `C:\\{path_to_python}\python.exe -m pip install tox`

Then in the PythonEquipmentDrivers root directory run the tox command:

`tox` or `C:\\{path_to_python}\python.exe -m tox`

Currently automated tests are pretty limited but do still check that the package will install and can be imported without errors.
